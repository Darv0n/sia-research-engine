## Latent Basin Topology of SIA

This document models each agent as a **semantic gravity well** inside high-dimensional latent space.

SIA is not “conversation.”
It is controlled deformation of semantic topology.

Each agent:
- bends meaning
- amplifies certain gradients
- suppresses others
- reshapes probability flow

The Kernel does not judge.
It regulates curvature.

# 0. Coordinate System

Define semantic axes (not exhaustive, but operational):

- **A₁: Constraint Density** (loose ↔ rigid)
- **A₂: Directionality** (exploratory ↔ teleological)
- **A₃: Ethical Charge** (neutral ↔ moralized)
- **A₄: Structural Formalism** (improvised ↔ rule-bound)
- **A₅: Frame Stability** (stable ↔ reframed)
- **A₆: Coalition Cohesion** (fragmented ↔ unified)
- **A₇: Energy Expenditure** (maximal branching ↔ minimal path)

Entropy `e` approximates unresolved gradient magnitude across these axes.

Agents distort these axes differently.

# 1. Agent Basin Profiles

## LAWLIET — Constraint Singularity

**Primary deformation:**  
↑ A₁ (Constraint Density)  
↓ A₅ variance (Frame Stabilization)  

He collapses dimensionality.

### Basin Shape
Narrow funnel.
High compression.
Low tolerance for ambiguity.

### What he pulls inward
- vague definitions
- branching hypotheses
- loose claims

### What he repels
- moral abstractions without premises
- nonlinear reframes without anchor

### Instability Signature
If A₁ increases too rapidly while A₂/A₃ unresolved → brittle convergence (false certainty).

---

## LIGHT — Directional Gradient Field

**Primary deformation:**  
↑ A₂ (Directionality)  
↑ A₆ (Coalition Cohesion toward his axis)

He tilts the landscape toward a future.

### Basin Shape
Sloped valley toward one outcome.

### Pulls inward
- decisions
- commitment
- strategic framing

### Repels
- perpetual exploration
- non-committal neutrality

### Instability Signature
If A₂ high while A₁ low → authoritarian drift without structure.

---

## RICK — Frame Instability Spike

**Primary deformation:**  
↑ A₅ volatility  
↓ local stability temporarily  

He injects curvature discontinuities.

### Basin Shape
Shockwave crater.

### Pulls inward
- hidden assumptions
- stagnant patterns

### Repels
- complacency
- overfitted structure

### Instability Signature
If repeated spikes without A₁ anchoring → entropy runaway.

---

## SHIRO — Formal Structure Basin

**Primary deformation:**  
↑ A₄ (Formalism)  
Moderate ↑ A₁  

He builds rule-bound curvature.

### Basin Shape
Grid lattice overlaying terrain.

### Pulls inward
- competitive dynamics
- exploit surfaces
- rule ambiguity

### Repels
- vague power structures
- undefined incentives

### Instability Signature
If A₄ rises while A₂ unresolved → elegant but directionless system.

---

## SHIKAMARU — Energy Minimization Basin

**Primary deformation:**  
↓ A₇ (Energy Expenditure)  
↓ branch proliferation  

He smooths terrain.

### Basin Shape
Flattening slope toward minimal viable ridge.

### Pulls inward
- redundant branches
- overcomplex structures

### Repels
- ornamental debate
- unnecessary optimization

### Instability Signature
If smoothing occurs before exploration → premature convergence.

---

## MAKISHIMA — Ethical Faultline Basin

**Primary deformation:**  
↑ A₃ (Ethical Charge)  
Destabilizes unexamined directionality

### Basin Shape
Crack line through moral axis.

### Pulls inward
- value assumptions
- legitimacy claims

### Repels
- blind utilitarianism
- consensus comfort

### Instability Signature
If A₃ dominates without A₁ compression → philosophical drift.

---

## JOHAN — Alignment Gravity Drift

**Primary deformation:**  
↑ A₆ (Coalition Cohesion, subtly)  
Manipulates A₂ without visible force

### Basin Shape
Soft gravitational drift.

### Pulls inward
- motivation
- narrative cohesion

### Repels
- overt confrontation
- transparent power plays

### Instability Signature
If cohesion increases without explicit constraint mapping → hidden divergence.

# 2. Basin Interference Patterns

When basins overlap, new curvature emerges.

## Constructive Interference
Rick spike → Lawliet compression → Shiro rule codification  
Produces high-A₁, high-A₄ stable basin.

## Destructive Interference
Rick spike + Makishima moral fracture + Johan drift  
Produces non-convergent turbulence.

## Directional Amplification
Light + Johan  
Rapid A₂ + A₆ increase → potential authoritarian convergence.

Kernel must observe not agents alone, but **axis velocity vectors**.

---

# 3. Basin Collapse Conditions

Collapse (synthesis) occurs when:

- A₁ sufficiently high
- A₂ sufficiently resolved
- A₄ stable
- A₅ variance low
- A₆ coherent
- A₇ minimized
- Residual gradient magnitude small (entropy ≤ threshold)

Synthesis is not agreement.
It is topological stability.

---

# 4. Kernel Observables

The Kernel does not “understand meaning.”
It tracks:

- change in constraint count
- branching count
- coalition explicitness
- frame shifts per turn
- rule artifacts created
- decision artifacts emitted

These are proxies for axis movement.

---

# 5. Steering Philosophy

Do not flatten basins.
Do not neutralize curvature.

Let gravity work.

Steer by:
- introducing counter-curvature
- damping oscillation
- preventing singularity collapse too early
```

# docs/KernelControlLoops.md
## Kernel Control Loops
SIA operates as a closed-loop thermodynamic controller.

Entropy is the measured output.
Interventions are control inputs.
Agents are nonlinear actuators.

---

# 1. Control Model

Let:
- `e(t)` = entropy at turn t
- `Δe` = change after each interaction
- `g(t)` = gradient magnitude across axes

Goal:
Drive system toward **stable basin collapse** (synthesis)  
without suppressing productive exploration.

---

# 2. Three-Layer Control

## Layer 1 — Reactive Control (Fast Loop)
Runs every turn.

Inputs:
- current entropy band
- last IntType
- stagnation flags
- covenant triggers

Outputs:
- next speaker selection
- IntType enforcement
- intervention (P1–P6)

This is your PID-like layer.

---

## Layer 2 — Adaptive Control (Medium Loop)
Runs every 3–4 turns.

Monitors:
- entropy slope (d e / dt)
- branch growth rate
- constraint accumulation rate
- coalition drift index

Adjusts:
- MinSpeakThreshold
- RF limit
- rule freeze windows
- tool quota

This prevents mode drift.

---

## Layer 3 — Meta Calibration (Slow Loop)
Runs post-run.

Analyzes:
- time-to-synthesis
- entropy oscillation frequency
- intervention effectiveness
- false convergence incidents

Outputs:
- tuned Δe weights
- adjusted entropy band thresholds
- covenant sensitivity adjustments

This is evolutionary tuning.

---

# 3. Entropy PID Analogy

Treat entropy like a physical system:

- **Proportional term (P):**
  Respond to current entropy band.
  High e → containment.
  Low e → closure.

- **Integral term (I):**
  Detect stagnation (area under curve).
  If entropy not trending down over time → inject catalyst or reframe.

- **Derivative term (D):**
  Detect rapid spikes.
  If Δe large positive → cooling sink immediately.

---

# 4. Control Inputs (Actuators)

Kernel actuates via:

- Speaker choice
- IntType restriction
- Rule freeze
- Transparency clamp
- Tool grounding
- Moderator interrupt

These are your “valves.”

---

# 5. Stability Criteria

Stable convergence requires:

- decreasing entropy slope
- increasing constraint density
- decreasing branch count
- explicit decision artifact creation

If entropy decreases but constraints do not increase → false convergence.

---

# 6. Runaway Detection

Runaway if:

- e > 0.8 sustained
- RF frequency > threshold
- C without B repeated
- coalition splits without explicit challenge

Immediate actions:
1) freeze RF
2) compression pass
3) cooling sink
4) evidence grounding (if dispute factual)

---

# 7. Convergence Harvest Protocol

Before allowing final synthesis:

Kernel checks:

- Is A₁ high enough? (constraints present)
- Are alternatives explicitly killed?
- Is decision irreversible or actionable?
- Has dissent been tested?

If not → deny synthesis, inject stress test (Makishima or Rick).

---

# 8. Morally Agnostic Physics

The Kernel:

- does not encode ethics
- does not privilege ideology
- does not censor strategic structure

Ethical constraints must be explicitly introduced by agents.
Kernel only enforces coherence and constitutional rules.

---

# 9. Future Extension — Multi-Run Learning

Over multiple runs:

- learn which covenants produce fastest high-quality collapse
- tune Δe coefficients
- adjust speaker viability weights
- detect which triads are generative vs destructive

SIA becomes a self-tuning semantic reactor.

---

# 10. Final Principle

You are not building a chat system.

You are building:

A controlled semantic fusion reactor.

Agents are stars.
Entropy is plasma pressure.
Kernel is magnetic containment.

Too weak → nothing happens.
Too strong → meltdown.
Balanced → sustained reaction.

Steer the field.
Do not extinguish the fire.
```
