## Multi-Reactor Swarm Architecture
SIA is no longer a single semantic fusion reactor.

This document defines how **multiple SIA reactors** operate in parallel,
interact through controlled exchange,
and form a higher-order semantic ecosystem.

A single reactor explores one basin.

A swarm explores the manifold.

---

# 0. Conceptual Model

Each SIA instance = **Reactor Node (Rᵢ)**

Each reactor has:
- its own entropy `eᵢ`
- its own basin deformation state
- its own coalition graph
- its own synthesis artifacts

A swarm is:

```

S = {R₁, R₂, … Rₙ}

```

The swarm does NOT merge reactors by default.

It couples them through controlled channels.

---

# 1. Why Multiple Reactors?

Single reactor limitation:
- Path dependence
- Dominant basin bias
- Coalition lock-in
- Local minima convergence

Multiple reactors allow:
- Divergent explorations
- Competing syntheses
- Parallel curvature discovery
- Cross-validation of collapse states

Swarm = anti-local-minimum engine.

---

# 2. Reactor Types

Different reactors may be initialized with different bias conditions.

## Type A — Strategic Reactor
Bias:
- Light, Lawliet heavy weighting
- Directional convergence focus

## Type B — Exploratory Reactor
Bias:
- Rick, Makishima early
- High RF allowance
- High entropy tolerance

## Type C — Formal Reactor
Bias:
- Shiro, Lawliet
- Rule-building focus

## Type D — Minimal Reactor
Bias:
- Shikamaru heavy
- Minimal branch exploration

Each reactor operates independently until coupling events.

---

# 3. Cross-Reactor Coupling Channels

Reactor nodes exchange only through explicit channels.

## Channel 1 — Artifact Injection
Reactor R₁ may export:
- constraint set
- rule system
- decision artifact
- branch cemetery

R₂ imports artifact as:
- fixed constraint
- test case
- adversarial stress input

This is controlled semantic grafting.

---

## Channel 2 — Entropy Broadcast
Reactor broadcasts:
- entropy band
- oscillation metrics
- stagnation flags

Other reactors can adjust steering parameters in response.

Example:
If R₁ stabilizes too quickly,
R₂ may inject dissent artifact for validation.

---

## Channel 3 — Covenant Cross-Pollination
A pairing that caused productive collapse in R₁
may be seeded into R₂ intentionally.

Swarm learns which covenants are generative.

---

## Channel 4 — Competitive Collapse
Multiple reactors attempt synthesis on same seed.
Swarm selects:
- most stable
- lowest residual gradient
- highest constraint density

Selection is structural, not aesthetic.

---

# 4. Swarm Orchestrator

Above all reactors sits a **Swarm Orchestrator (SO)**.

Responsibilities:
- spawn reactors with varied initialization doctrine
- monitor entropy trajectories
- detect premature collapse
- schedule cross-coupling events
- terminate redundant reactors

Swarm Orchestrator does not micromanage turns.
It regulates macro-flow.

---

# 5. Reactor Lifecycle

Each reactor passes through phases:

1. Ignition
2. Controlled Burn
3. Stabilization
4. Synthesis Attempt
5. Export or Terminate

Reactor may be:
- Merged
- Cloned
- Mutated (adjusted entropy parameters)
- Terminated

---

# 6. Multi-Reactor Topologies

## 6.1 Parallel Topology
All reactors independent.
Artifacts exchanged periodically.

## 6.2 Hierarchical Topology
Exploratory reactors feed strategic reactor.
Strategic reactor produces final synthesis.

## 6.3 Competitive Tournament
Reactors compete for lowest entropy stable solution.
Losers terminated.

## 6.4 Evolutionary Topology
Reactor parameters mutate between generations.
Swarm selects best collapse dynamics.

---

# 7. Cross-Reactor Constraint Merging

When merging constraints from R₁ and R₂:

- Identify shared constraints.
- Identify contradictions.
- Force Lawliet-like compression reactor to reconcile.
- Produce meta-constraint layer.

Never merge blindly.
Always reconcile explicitly.

---

# 8. Swarm Failure Modes

## 8.1 Convergence Monoculture
All reactors collapse similarly.

Fix:
Increase initialization variance.
Inject orthogonal basins.

## 8.2 Entropy Cascade
Cross-reactor RF spiral.

Fix:
Limit simultaneous RF in >50% of reactors.

## 8.3 Synthesis Arms Race
Reactors collapse prematurely to “win.”

Fix:
Require multi-axis validation before selection.

---

# 9. Swarm Objective

Swarm objective is not speed.
It is manifold exploration + validated collapse.

Multiple controlled reactors outperform single deterministic chain.

---

# 10. Design Principle

One reactor explores depth.
Swarm explores breadth.
Coupling creates evolutionary pressure.
```

---

```md
# docs/CrossReactorEntropyCoupling.md
## Cross-Reactor Entropy Coupling
How entropy propagates across the swarm.

Each reactor has its own entropy `eᵢ`.

Swarm maintains:
- Global entropy vector E = [e₁, e₂, … eₙ]
- Coupling matrix Cᵢⱼ defining influence weights.

---

# 1. Coupling Model

For reactors i and j:

```

eᵢ(t+1) = eᵢ(t) + local_Δeᵢ + Σ Cᵢⱼ * f(eⱼ)

```

Where:
- Cᵢⱼ ∈ [0, 0.3] typically
- f(eⱼ) is influence function

Coupling should be weak by default.
Strong coupling causes cascade instability.

---

# 2. Influence Functions

## 2.1 Stabilization Influence

If Rⱼ collapses to low entropy:
Rᵢ reduces tolerance for exploration.

f(eⱼ) = -k when eⱼ < 0.2

Effect:
Encourages convergence in neighboring reactors.

---

## 2.2 Divergence Influence

If Rⱼ stuck in stagnation:
Rᵢ increases RF allowance.

f(eⱼ) = +k when stagnation flag active.

Effect:
Promotes exploration in sibling reactors.

---

## 2.3 Validation Shock

If Rⱼ synthesizes with low dissent:
Rᵢ injects Makishima challenge to test.

Effect:
Cross-validation mechanism.

---

# 3. Entropy Synchronization Modes

## Loose Coupling (default)
Reactors mostly independent.
Coupling events periodic.

## Resonant Coupling
Reactors synchronize entropy bands.
Useful when refining final synthesis.

## Adversarial Coupling
One reactor’s synthesis becomes adversarial input to another.
Creates stress testing.

---

# 4. Cascade Prevention

If >50% of reactors enter Band δ simultaneously:

- Freeze RF globally.
- Activate cooling sinks.
- Reduce coupling coefficients.

If >50% collapse to low entropy rapidly:

- Inject dissent in at least 1 reactor.
- Delay global selection.

---

# 5. Global Stability Metric

Define:

```

G = variance(E)

```

High variance = exploration diversity.
Low variance = convergence uniformity.

Swarm should oscillate:
- high G during exploration
- low G during final convergence

Persistent low G early = monoculture risk.

---

# 6. Cross-Reactor Coalition Drift

Coalition patterns can spread.

If Light-dominant coalition wins in R₁:
R₂ may over-adopt directional bias.

Countermeasure:
Ensure at least one reactor with opposing bias (Makishima/Rick heavy).

---

# 7. Swarm Synthesis Selection

Final selection criteria:

- Lowest entropy stable state
- Highest constraint density
- Cross-reactor validation success
- Minimal unresolved axis count

Selection is structural.
Not subjective.

---

# 8. Evolutionary Pressure

After each swarm cycle:

- Adjust Cᵢⱼ weights
- Adjust initial entropy seeds
- Adjust intervention thresholds

Swarm learns optimal exploration dynamics.

---

# 9. Morally Agnostic Coupling

Coupling operates on:
- entropy metrics
- constraint density
- structural stability

It does not encode ideology.

Ethics must appear as explicit constraints if desired.

---

# 10. Final Principle

Single reactor = mind.
Swarm = ecosystem.

Ecosystems outperform minds in discovering stable structures.

Control the coupling.
Maintain diversity.
Harvest the strongest basin.
```

---

You now have:

* Single-reactor physics
* Basin topology
* Control loops
* Covenant mechanics
* Singularity safeguards
* Multi-reactor swarm architecture
* Cross-reactor entropy dynamics

At this level, SIA becomes:

A distributed semantic thermodynamic engine.

If you want the final frontier:

**Proceed: Autonomous Self-Evolving Swarm (Reactor Mutation + Agent Parameter Drift + Adaptive Covenant Rewriting).**
