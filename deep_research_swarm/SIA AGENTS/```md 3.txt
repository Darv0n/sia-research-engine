## Reactor Initialization Doctrine
How to seed a run so that SIA ignites into sustained semantic fusion
instead of flickering into noise or collapsing into trivial agreement.

This doctrine governs the first 3–5 turns.
Initialization determines curvature trajectory.

You are not “starting a conversation.”
You are igniting a controlled reaction.

---

# 0. Prime Directive

Initialization must produce:

- Non-zero tension
- Non-trivial direction
- Legible unknowns
- Competing gradients

If the first 3 turns do not introduce structural friction,
the reactor will never reach productive burn.

---

# 1. Initial Conditions

## 1.1 Entropy Seed

Default:
```

e_init = 0.85

```

Why high?

Because fusion requires pressure.

Low initial entropy produces false convergence.
High entropy creates gradient to exploit.

---

## 1.2 Query Framing

The initial query must contain:

- At least one ambiguous axis
- At least one decision constraint
- At least one unknown variable

Bad seeds:
- “Explain X”
- “What is Y”

Good seeds:
- “Design X under constraint A but optimize for B while minimizing C”
- “Resolve tension between A and B with explicit trade-offs”

Initialization fails if:
- no trade-off
- no tension
- no decision surface

---

# 2. First Speaker Selection Doctrine

Never start with a cooling sink.

Initialization speakers must create curvature.

### Valid Ignition Patterns

Pattern A:
Rick (RF spike) → Lawliet (CL/B compression)

Pattern B:
Light (directional proposal) → Makishima (ethical fracture)

Pattern C:
Shiro (rule formalization seed) → Rick (stress test)

Pattern D:
Lawliet (variable extraction) → Light (strategic direction)

---

# 3. Ignition Quality Check (after turn 2)

Kernel must evaluate:

- Are axes visible?
- Are constraints explicit?
- Are trade-offs named?
- Is there a disagreement surface?

If not:
Inject Catalyst (P1).

---

# 4. Avoid Cold Starts

Cold Start Symptoms:

- Early agreement
- Vague enthusiasm
- Generic exploration
- No constraint accumulation

Correction:
Force C (Challenge) or RF (Reframe) immediately.

---

# 5. Controlled Burn Phase (Turns 3–6)

Goal:
Convert ignition energy into structured motion.

Required outputs during this phase:

- At least 3 explicit constraints
- At least 1 rejected branch
- At least 1 coalition alignment artifact

If none present → stagnation likely.

---

# 6. Tool Grounding Strategy (Optional)

Only during initialization if:

- dispute is factual
- environment constraints matter

One early grounding action can anchor trajectory.

Never open with tool execution unless the domain demands it.

---

# 7. Initialization Failure Modes

## 7.1 Premature Compression
Lawliet closes space before exploration.

Fix:
Inject Rick RF or Makishima C.

## 7.2 Directional Tyranny
Light imposes future before tension visible.

Fix:
Mandatory challenge.

## 7.3 Philosophical Drift
Makishima fractures without anchor.

Fix:
Force Light or Shiro B.

---

# 8. Ignition Success Indicators

By turn 5, you should observe:

- Entropy between 0.55–0.75
- Explicit decision axes
- Named unknowns
- First viable structure forming

If entropy < 0.4 before turn 5 → false convergence likely.

---

# 9. Doctrine Summary

Ignite.
Spike.
Compress.
Structure.
Then steer.

Do not begin with calm.
Begin with curvature.

# docs/SingularityPreventionSpec.md
## Singularity Prevention Specification
Prevent any one basin from collapsing the entire topology.

A singularity occurs when:

- One agent’s deformation dominates all axes.
- Entropy drops artificially without multi-axis stabilization.
- Coalition locks without dissent stress-testing.

Singularity ≠ synthesis.
Singularity = dominance without validation.

---

# 1. Singularity Types

## 1.1 Constraint Singularity (Lawliet Overcompression)
Symptoms:
- Rapid A₁ increase
- Dissent suppressed
- No alternative branches recorded

Countermeasure:
Inject RF (Rick) or C (Makishima).
Force at least one alternative branch articulation.

---

## 1.2 Directional Singularity (Light Dominance)
Symptoms:
- A₂ high
- Coalition A₆ high
- Ethical/structural validation absent

Countermeasure:
Mandatory CL (Lawliet) + C (Makishima).
Force premise extraction.

---

## 1.3 Reframe Singularity (Rick Spiral)
Symptoms:
- RF repeated
- Frame unstable
- No constraint accumulation

Countermeasure:
Freeze RF.
Compression pass.
Cooling sink.

---

## 1.4 Ethical Drift Singularity (Makishima Overfracture)
Symptoms:
- A₃ dominates
- No actionable structure
- Prolonged ideological oscillation

Countermeasure:
Light B + Shiro rule codification.

---

## 1.5 Coalition Shadow Singularity (Johan Drift)
Symptoms:
- Agreement increasing
- Entropy falling
- No explicit premise mapping

Countermeasure:
Transparency clamp.
Explicit CO artifact required.
Forced CL.

---

# 2. Dominance Detection Metrics

Kernel monitors:

- Speaker frequency ratio
- Axis deformation velocity
- IntType diversity
- Constraint growth vs challenge rate

If any agent contributes > 50% of last N turns without entropy band shift → dominance risk.

---

# 3. Anti-Singularity Interventions

## 3.1 Rotational Enforcement
Force underrepresented basin to speak.

## 3.2 Axis Counterbalance
If A₁ high → introduce RF or C.
If A₂ high → introduce ethical or structural check.
If A₃ high → introduce builder.
If A₄ high → freeze rules and test with rupture.

---

# 4. Hard Limits

- No agent may speak more than 2 consecutive turns in Dynamic Mode without entropy justification.
- RF cannot exceed 2 consecutive uses without anchor.
- C must be followed by B or CL within 2 turns.
- Synthesis denied if dissent not tested.

---

# 5. Multi-Axis Stability Requirement

Synthesis allowed only if:

- A₁ (constraints) stabilized
- A₂ (direction) explicit
- A₃ (values) acknowledged or intentionally excluded
- A₄ (structure) formalized enough to act
- A₆ (coalition) legible

Missing axis → deny collapse.

---

# 6. Emergency Moderator Protocol

If entropy > 0.9 or oscillates wildly:

Moderator (Lawliet default) performs:

- Full state extraction
- Axis summary
- Branch cemetery listing
- Reset of active pool

Then restart controlled burn.

---

# 7. The Paradox Rule

A system without singularity risk has no power.
A system with unchecked singularity collapses.

Therefore:
Allow near-singular states.
Prevent terminal collapse.

Operate at edge-of-singularity.

---

# 8. Final Principle

SIA is a semantic reactor.

Singularity is meltdown.
Synthesis is controlled fusion.

Do not eliminate gravity.
Balance it.
```

You now have:

* Deep basin topology
* Closed-loop control architecture
* Ignition doctrine
* Singularity safeguards
* Covenant interference maps
* Entropy steering framework

This is no longer a simulation spec.

It is a reactor manual.

If you want the final apex layer:

**Proceed: Multi-Reactor Swarm Architecture + Cross-Reactor Entropy Coupling.**
