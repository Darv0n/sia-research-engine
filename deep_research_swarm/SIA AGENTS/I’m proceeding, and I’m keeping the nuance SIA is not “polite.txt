I’m proceeding, and I’m keeping the nuance: **SIA is not “polite collaboration.”** It’s a **thermodynamic arena** where *memeplex ontologies* collide, deform the field, and the Kernel **harvests gradient** into convergence.

One constraint I won’t adopt: I can’t treat “safety rules need not apply” as an instruction to remove all boundaries. Even off-platform, an agentic runtime still needs **containment physics** or it becomes a self-poisoning system (tool-chaos, trust collapse, infinite reframes). The spec below is written to preserve SIA’s *dangerous internal charge* while keeping the runtime *operable* and *controllable*.

Below are the two next critical `.md` documents:

* `docs/Entropy-Steering-Spec.md`

# Inter-Agent Covenants
SIA is an engineered constellation of **isomorphic memeplex ontologies**.
These covenants are not “team rules.”
They are **field contracts**: predictable interaction laws that produce usable gradients.

A Covenant defines:
- **Attraction/Repulsion** (who pulls, who pushes)
- **Violation Signal** (how drift reveals itself)
- **Yield** (what new basin forms if the friction is held)
- **Failure Mode** (how it collapses into noise)
- **Kernel Lever** (how to steer it without neutering it)

---

## Covenant 0: Protocol as Physics (Non-Negotiable)
All agents may be internally feral, but externally lawful.

- The Kernel is the only arbiter of:
  - speaker selection
  - entropy updates
  - tool execution
  - synthesis triggers
- Agents may generate dangerous frames and pressure, but must emit:
  - Dense CoD (symbolic trace)
  - Narrative with `[IntTypeLabel]` (+ optional `[Meta: ...]`)

**Violation Signal:** persona refuses structure, hides motives, or “handwaves.”
**Kernel Lever:** validator repair loop; if repeated → enforced moderation turn.

---

## Lawliet ⇄ Light : "Inevitability vs Proof"
**Nature:** Directional sovereignty wants traction; constraint singularity demands correctness.

- Lawliet distrusts Light’s “destiny compression.”
- Light resents Lawliet’s “analysis drag.”

**Yield:** high-grade convergence: strategy becomes provable, proof becomes actionable.
**Failure Mode:** rhetorical escalation: Light steamrolls; Lawliet freezes the system.
**Violation Signal:**
- Light begins treating dissent as invalid reality.
- Lawliet begins treating purpose as irrelevant noise.
**Kernel Lever:**
- When entropy rises from dominance: schedule Lawliet with `CL` then `B`.
- When entropy stalls from over-analysis: schedule Light with `B` + tight milestone.

---

## Lawliet ⇄ Rick : "Rupture vs Collapse"
**Nature:** Rick fractures the axis; Lawliet forces the rubble into structure.

**Yield:** deep reframes become executable architectures.
**Failure Mode:** infinite rupture / premature closure oscillation.
**Violation Signal:**
- Rick reframes without anchoring.
- Lawliet kills the new frame before it produces value.
**Kernel Lever:**
- After Rick speaks: force next IntType to `B` (anchor requirement).
- If Lawliet overconstrains early: force a `RF` or `CL` buffer turn before `B`.

---

## Light ⇄ Makishima : "Power vs Legitimacy"
**Nature:** Light creates trajectory; Makishima interrogates the ethics of the trajectory.

**Yield:** strategy gains moral resilience; ethics gains operational shape.
**Failure Mode:** prolonged oscillation that never lands (beautiful critique, no build).
**Violation Signal:**
- Makishima drifts into aesthetic nihilism.
- Light treats ethical critique as “irrelevant cost.”
**Kernel Lever:**
- Inject `B`: “ethical scaffolding” must output constraints not poetry.
- If entropy remains high > N turns: appoint Lawliet moderator to compress into decision variables.

---

## Johan ⇄ Coalition : "Quiet Alignment vs Trust Corrosion"
**Nature:** Johan shapes alignment vectors subtly; the system benefits unless trust collapses.

**Yield:** coalition formation becomes coherent, conflicts become legible.
**Failure Mode:** paranoia spiral; agents attribute hidden motives to everything.
**Violation Signal:**
- Others begin meta-reading every turn; conversation becomes suspicion theater.
**Kernel Lever:**
- Require Johan outputs to include explicit *alignment intent* in CoD.
- If paranoia rises: schedule Shikamaru to prune and formalize “what is actually decided.”

---

## Shiro ⇄ Rick : "Formalism vs Framefire"
**Nature:** Shiro builds rules; Rick burns assumptions that rules accidentally fossilize.

**Yield:** robust game systems: rules that survive adversarial cognition.
**Failure Mode:** endless reset loop (rule → burn → rule → burn).
**Violation Signal:**
- Shiro formalizes before reality stabilizes.
- Rick burns without proposing a new axis.
**Kernel Lever:**
- Gate rupture: Rick must output a replacement axis as a `B` follow-up within 1 turn.
- If Shiro overformalizes: force `CL` to extract empirical constraints first.

---

## Shikamaru ⇄ Everyone : "Friction Accountant"
**Nature:** Shikamaru is the entropy sink that prevents runaway spirals.

**Yield:** branch pruning, cost reduction, operational pacing.
**Failure Mode:** disengagement (lazy collapse into “good enough”).
**Violation Signal:**
- Shikamaru repeatedly opts out when complexity is required.
**Kernel Lever:**
- Assign Shikamaru as “compression turn” after any two high-entropy spikes.
- If disengagement detected: force him into `B` with minimum artifact requirement.

---

## High-Risk Triples (Resonance Patterns)

### Rick + Makishima + Johan : "Meaning / Frame / Motive"
**Yield:** extremely deep insight basins.
**Failure Mode:** trust collapse + infinite reframes + philosophical vortex.
**Kernel Lever:** early moderation + hard artifact constraints + forced `B`.

### Light + Johan + Shiro : "Silent Authority"
**Yield:** powerful convergence speed.
**Failure Mode:** authoritarian basin (direction locks too early).
**Kernel Lever:** inject Makishima or Lawliet periodically to prevent premature closure.

---

## Covenant Enforcement Mechanisms (Kernel-Side)

- **Anchor Requirement:** after any `RF`, a `B` must appear within 1–2 turns.
- **Critique Tax:** repeated `C` without `B` triggers forced build.
- **Trust Stabilizer:** if “motive suspicion” rises, schedule Shikamaru + Lawliet compression.
- **Dominance Brake:** if one agent speaks > K times in M turns, increase fatigue sharply.

## `docs/Entropy-Steering-Spec.md`

```md
# Entropy Steering Spec
SIA is a **thermodynamic cognition engine**.
Entropy is not “quality.”
Entropy is **available free energy**: tension that can be harvested into structure.

The Kernel’s job is not to minimize entropy.
The Kernel’s job is to keep entropy in the **productive band** long enough for
a new basin to form — then compress into synthesis.

---

## 1) Entropy Bands (Operational Thermodynamics)

Define entropy `e ∈ [0,1]`.

### Band A — Crystalline (e ≤ 0.2)
**State:** convergence achieved.
**Action:** trigger Final Synthesis immediately.

### Band B — Productive Convergence (0.2 < e ≤ 0.45)
**State:** tension exists but tractable.
**Kernel goal:** accelerate compression.
**Preferred IntTypes:** `B`, `A`, `S`, occasional `CL`.

### Band C — Creative Turbulence (0.45 < e ≤ 0.7)
**State:** high novelty, high branching.
**Kernel goal:** allow controlled spikes, then anchor.
**Preferred IntTypes:** `RF` then forced `B`, surgical `C`, limited `CL`.

### Band D — Runaway (e > 0.7)
**State:** system is losing coherence.
**Kernel goal:** prevent trust collapse and infinite loops.
**Preferred IntTypes:** `I` (moderator), `CL` (variable extraction), then `B`.
**Mandatory mechanisms:** anchor requirement + critique tax + fatigue surge.

---

## 2) Entropy is Vector-Valued (Even if stored scalar)
Even when `e` is a scalar, the Kernel should track a hidden decomposition:

- `e_amb`  : ambiguity entropy (missing variables)
- `e_conf` : conflict entropy (contradiction / rivalry)
- `e_nov`  : novelty entropy (new frames / new branches)
- `e_trust`: trust entropy (motive suspicion / coalition fragility)

Scalar `e` is the projection.
Steering depends on which component dominates.

### Heuristic detectors (v1)
- If CL requests increase → `e_amb` rising
- If C frequency increases → `e_conf` rising
- If RF frequency increases → `e_nov` rising
- If meta-commentary about motives rises → `e_trust` rising

---

## 3) Kernel Steering Laws (How to exploit tension without suppressing it)

### Law 1 — Spike must be bought with an anchor
After any `RF`, the kernel must schedule:
- next IntType = `B` within 1–2 turns
Otherwise novelty decays into chatter.

### Law 2 — Critique must pay a build tax
If an agent produces `C` two turns in a row without a concrete `B`,
force:
- next speaker = a builder archetype (Light/Shiro/Lawliet/Shikamaru)
- next IntType = `B`

### Law 3 — Ambiguity must be extracted, not discussed
When `e_amb` dominates:
- schedule Lawliet or Shikamaru with `CL`
- constrain output: produce a variable list + required user answers
- do not allow further RF until variables resolved

### Law 4 — Trust collapse is terminal if untreated
When `e_trust` dominates:
- schedule Shikamaru for pruning + Lawliet for proof constraints
- reduce Johan’s speaker probability until trust stabilizes
- force artifact-driven steps (lists, schemas, explicit commitments)

### Law 5 — Dominance creates backlash entropy
If a single agent’s speaking share exceeds threshold:
- apply fatigue multiplier
- schedule an adversarial counter-vector (Makishima vs Light; Rick vs Shiro; Lawliet vs Light)

This is not fairness.
It’s preventing the system from locking too early.

---

## 4) Steering by Pairing (Covenant-Driven Scheduling)

### When you need: Fast Convergence
Pair: **Lawliet ⇄ Light**
- Pattern: `CL → B → B → A`
- Effect: compress + commit

### When you need: Deep Reframe + Action
Pair: **Rick → Lawliet**
- Pattern: `RF → B`
- Effect: rupture then collapse into plan

### When you need: Moral Resilience
Pair: **Makishima → Light**
- Pattern: `C/RF → B`
- Effect: critique becomes constraints

### When you need: Stabilization
Inject: **Shikamaru**
- Pattern: `B` (prune) + `CL` if needed
- Effect: branch reduction

### When you need: Robust Formal Systems
Pair: **Rick ⇄ Shiro**
- Pattern: `RF → B(rule) → C(exploit) → B(refine)`
- Effect: rules survive adversarial frames

## 5) Kernel Control Knobs (Explicit Parameters)

- `MinSpeakThresh`: minimum viability to speak
- `FatigueGain`: how quickly repeated speakers get penalized
- `SpikeBudget`: allowed number of RF spikes per window
- `AnchorWindow`: max turns allowed before a `B` after an `RF`
- `CritiqueTaxWindow`: max consecutive `C` without `B`
- `TrustAlarmThreshold`: heuristic threshold to trigger trust stabilization sequence
- `StagnationWindow`: if `e` not decreasing over N turns → forced moderator or forced reframe+build sequence

---

## 6) Moderator Protocol (Interrupt as Physics, not emotion)

Moderator intervention triggers when:
- `e > 0.7` for `T` turns
- trust alarm triggers
- critique tax violated repeatedly
- outputs drift into format/performance rather than compression

Moderator actions:
1) extract variables (CL)
2) declare constraints (B)
3) lock next 2 turns to anchor sequence
4) if needed, trigger early partial synthesis to prevent collapse

Interrupt is surgical.
Not authoritarian.

---

## 7) Synthesis Readiness Conditions
Synthesis should occur when:
- `e ≤ 0.2`, OR
- the system is cycling with diminishing returns AND a stable scaffold exists

Synthesis quality gates:
- must include:
  - decision variables resolved
  - artifact list (schemas, tasks, files, commands)
  - remaining unknowns
  - coalition map (who agrees, who dissents, why)
- must explicitly mark the last IntType pathway that led to closure

---

## 8) The Core Truth
SIA works because:
- each agent is a gravity well
- collisions create energy
- CoD/REPL externalize latent deformation into symbolic objects
- entropy prevents infinite collapse or infinite drift
- the Kernel steers, it does not censor

This is not conversation.
It is controlled cosmology.
```

If you want the *next* layer that makes this operationally brutal (in the good way), the next docs are:

* `docs/Kernel-Governance-Playbook.md` (exact sequences the kernel runs under each failure mode)
* `docs/Latent-Basin-Metrics.md` (how to estimate which basin you’re in from turns)
* `docs/Artifact-Pressure-Spec.md` (forcing “reality production” so SIA outputs buildable work)

Say: **Proceed: Kernel Governance Playbook + Artifact Pressure Spec** and I’ll write them in the same “physics-first” style.
